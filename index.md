## 1st Workshop on Type-Driven Development (TyDe '16)

### Dependently Typed and Generic Programming

### Goals of the workshop

The workshop on Type-Driven Development aims to show how static type
information may be used effectively in the development of computer
programs. The workshop, co-located with
[ICFP](http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2016), unifies two workshops: the
Workshop on Dependently Typed Programming and the Workshop on Generic
Programming.

These two research areas have a rich history and bridge both theory and
practice. Novel techniques explored by both communities has gradually
spread to more mainstream languages. This workshop aims to bring
together leading researchers and practitioners in generic programming
and dependently typed programming from around the world, and features
papers capturing the state of the art in these important areas.

We welcome all contributions, both theoretical and practical, on:

  * dependently typed programming;
  * generic programming;
  * design and implementation of programming languages, exploiting
    types in novel ways;
  * exploiting typed data, data dependent data, or type providers;
  * static and dynamic analyses of typed programs;
  * tools, IDEs, or testing tools exploiting type information;
  * pearls, being elegant, instructive examples of types used in the
    derivation, calculation, or construction of programs.

### Proceedings and Copyright

We plan to have formal proceedings, published by the ACM. Accepted
papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors must grant
[ACM publication rights upon
acceptance](http://authors.acm.org/main.html), but may retain
copyright if they wish. Authors are encouraged to publish auxiliary
material with their paper (source code, test data, and so forth). The
proceedings will be freely available for download from the ACM Digital
Library from one week before the start of the conference until two
weeks after the conference.

### Submission details

Submitted papers should fall into one of two categories:

  * Regular research papers (12 pages, excluding bibliography)
  * Extended abstracts (2 pages, including bibliography)

Submission is via
[Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tyde16).

Regular research papers are expected to present novel and interesting
research results. Extended abstracts should report work in progress
that the authors would like to present at the workshop. 

We welcome submissions from PC members (with the exception of the two
co-chairs), but these submissions will be held to a higher standard.

All submissions should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines (two-column, 9pt).  Extended
abstracts must be submitted with the label 'Extended abstract' clearly
in the title.

### Important Dates

  * Regular paper deadline:     Friday, 10th June, 2016 
  * Extended abstract deadline: Friday, 24th June, 2016
  * Author notification:        Friday, 8th July, 2016
  * Camera ready deadline:      Sunday, 31st July, 2016
  * Workshop:                   Sunday, 18th September, 2016

### Travel Support

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant
to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as
for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC program, see [its web page](http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).
