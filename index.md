## 1st Workshop on Type-directed Development (TyDe '16)

### Goals of the workshop


The workshop on Type Directed Programming aims to show how static type
information may be used effectively in the development of computer
programs. The workshop unifies two workshops that have been held
previously at ICFP: the Workshop on Generic Programming and the
Workshop on Dependently Typed Programming.

These two research areas have a rich history, both to practitioners
and to theoreticians, and a deep connection with the functional
programming community. Novel techniques explored by both communities
has gradually spread to more mainstream languages. This workshop
brings together leading researchers and practitioners in generic
programming and dependently typed programming from around the world,
and features papers capturing the state of the art in these important
areas.

We welcome all contributions, both theoretical and practical of:

  * generic programming,
  * programming with dependent types,
  * design and implementation of programming languages, exploiting
    types in novel ways,
  * exploiting typed data, data dependent data, type providers
  * static and dynamic analyses of typed programs,
  * tools, IDEs, or testing tools exploiting type information,
  * pearls, being elegant, instructive examples of types used in the
    derivation, calculation, or construction of programs;

### Proceedings and Copyright


We plan to have formal proceedings, published by the ACM. Accepted
papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors must grant
[ACM publication rights upon
acceptance](http://authors.acm.org/main.html), but may retain
copyright if they wish. Authors are encouraged to publish auxiliary
material with their paper (source code, test data, and so forth). The
proceedings will be freely available for download from the ACM Digital
Library from one week before the start of the conference until two
weeks after the conference.

### Submission details

  * Submission deadline:        Friday, 10th June, 2016 
  * Extended abstract deadline: TBA
  * Author notification:        Friday, 8th July, 2016
  * Final version due:          TBA
  * Workshop:                   Sunday, 18th September, 2016

Submitted papers should fall into one of two categories:

  * Regular research papers (12 pages)
  * Extended abstracts (2 pages)

Regular research papers are expected to present novel and interesting
research results. Extended abstracts should report work in progress
that the authors would like to present at the workshop. 

All submissions should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines (two-column, 9pt). Regular
research papers must not exceed 12 pages. Extended abstracts must not
exceed 2 pages; if applicable, the with the label 'Extended abstract'.

Papers should be submitted via [Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tyde16).

### Travel Support

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant
to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as
for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC program, see [its web page](http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).
